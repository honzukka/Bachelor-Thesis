Introduce the problem, explain why it is interesting and outline the goal of the thesis.

\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce the problem
\item Describe what has already been done
\item {\bf Emphasize what we want to achieve}
\item Mention the structure of the thesis
\end{itemize}

More in detail:

\begin{itemize}
\item The problem is that current visualization methods in Morphome3cs which work with homologous meshes are not sufficient.
\item Various metrics are being visualized by vertex color. Also mention related difference visualizations and that they all solve a slightly different problem (no homologous meshes) and mostly also just use color.
\item {\bf The goal is to come up with a good arrow-based visualization and experiment with the visual appearance to get a satisfactory result.}
\item (Thesis structure)
\end{itemize}
