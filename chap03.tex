\section{Setting}
\label{sec:user_study-setting}

The goal of our study was to simulate use cases of both new and existing visualizations of the corresponding vertex distance metric and assess their performance in those use cases. Other difference metrics are out of scope of this thesis. Our general approach was to choose a pair of triangle meshes, find a specific difference between them and then generate several visualizations which would then help the user find the same difference. This corresponds to the situation where a certain difference metric is computed and needs to be presented in a clear way. In some cases, we asked a question we did not know the answer to. This corresponds to the situation where visualizations directly help to devise a result. Good visualizations therefore had to either help the participant answer correctly or create a clear agreement among the majority of participants.

We have prepared 10 questions, each of them tied to a specific pair of triangle meshes and a difference between them. Each question was accompanied by four different visualizations. We have split all the visualizations into four groups of ten such that each group contained one visualization for each question. Participants were assigned to one of the groups randomly at the beginning of the study and answered the questions with the help of visualizations from their group. At the end, we have compared the answers to each question among the four visualization groups.

Another criterion we used to compare visualizations was the time it took the participants to answer. The best visualizations should allow not only for correct but also for quick answers. This would mean that they contain enough information (correctness) and represent it clearly (speed). Participants did not know that time was measured.

\subsection{Data}

All triangle meshes used in the study were 3D scans of human faces kindly provided to us by the Laboratory of 3D Imaging and Analytical Methods of the Faculty of Science at Charles University. Overall, we have used six distinct mesh pairs to be able to study a larger range of difference and also to make the study more interesting to the participants.

\subsection{Visualizations}

For each question, we have chosen the four visualizations to be presented to the participants according to the following rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item Meshes without a visualization have to be included to allow for the contribution of visualizations in general to be measured.
\item The visualization which we expected to be the most suitable for the given task (see section \ref{sec:analysis-color}) has to be included.
\item The remaining visualizations should be as distinct as possible in order to account for unexpected results.
\item At least one existing and one new visualization type have to be included to allow for the differences between their performance to be captured.
\item Each visualization type presented in this thesis has to be present at least once in the whole data set.
\end{itemize}

After applying the visualizations to the six chosen mesh pairs, we have received 25 distinct pairs.

\subsection{Questions}

We have created the following types of questions based on the way they can be answered:

\begin{description}
\item [Left/Right] In these questions, participants were supposed to answer by clicking on one of the meshes.
\item [Yes/No] In these questions, participants were supposed to answer by choosing either ``Yes'' or ``No'' from a dropdown menu.
\item [Direction] In these questions, a specific direction selected from a dropdown menu was accepted as an answer.
\item [Location] In these questions, participants answered by choosing one of six predefined locations in a mesh from a dropdown menu.
\end{description}

Each question type also provided the possibility to answer ``Not sure'' when the participant did not understand the question or if the question was too difficult for them.

\subsection{Program}

We have modified MeshDiff for the purposes of the study. The only features which remained were the ability to load and interactively view pre-generated visualizations and to modify the view by toggles described in appendix \ref{sec:view_control}. We have added a tutorial at the beginning which gives the full instructions to the participant, therefore no prior knowledge of the program nor the subject of the study is required. The tutorial also lets the participant answer one sample question. 

We will now describe the course of one session of the study. At the beginning, the participant completes the tutorial. The program then provides feedback to the sample answer and explains why it was correct or incorrect. After that, 10 other questions are presented. Each of them begins with a description of the visualization currently being shown. When the participant agrees they have understood the description, the program starts to secretly measure time. When the answer is chosen and confirmed, the time elapsed is saved along with the value of the provided answer and the next question is presented.

The study program runs locally without the ability to connect to the Internet and the participant has to manually upload the file containing their answers to a provided URL after they have finished.

\subsection{Participants}

Total of 37 volunteers of various backgrounds, ages and nationalities have participated in the study. Due to this number being relatively low, we were not able to analyze the answers of domain experts and the general public separately, nor were we able to make any other distinction. The primary intention, however, was to target the general public because we believe that this is aligned with the purpose of visualizations as a tool to make the understanding of data or concepts as easy as possible.
