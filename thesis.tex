\def\Abstract{%
Morphome3cs, a program created by researchers at Charles University, allows users to process and analyze 3D data, mostly of anthropological and archaeological origin. Morphome3cs is also able to visualize the difference between two triangle meshes by encoding various metrics into vertex color. However, this one-dimensional information is not enough to display multiple metrics at the same time. To overcome this limitation, we implemented an algorithm which employs the techniques of vector field visualization and uses clustered 3D arrows to encode the metrics. Focusing on visual appearance, we applied it in several types of visualizations in an experimental application called MeshDiff. In order to find out if these new approaches should be incorporated into Morphome3cs, we also carried out a user study which evaluates the quality of the new visualizations in various use cases.
