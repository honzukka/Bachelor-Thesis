\chapter{Proposed Visualizations}

Presents the solution.

\begin{itemize}
\item Mention related works
\item Describe the main idea behind the clustering techniques used
\item Describe the main idea behind the various visualizations
\end{itemize}

More in detail:

\begin{itemize}
\item The main trick is to convert a mesh difference visualization problem to a vector field visualization problem. The methods developed there are very good and can be applied in our case. Talk about the research done for clustering.
\item Used methods were chosen because of their simplicity. In case they had proven insufficient, it would have been possible to replace them easily by a more sophisticated version as clustering only constitutes one part of the visualization process.
\item Now describe the solution.
\end{itemize}
