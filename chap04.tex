\chapter{Discussion}

In this chapter, we conclude the user study with a discussion of its results, strengths and weaknesses. In addition to that, we also include other observations and results based on the new visualizations.

\section{Study}

We cannot eliminate the possibility that the results of the study were influenced by the choice of data. We argue that humans are more sensitive 

\subsection{The Overall Contribution of Visualizations}

The answers to question 7 (see appendix \ref{sec:study-question7}), which requires participants to click on the face which has larger cheekbones has shown an overwhelming dominance of visualizations over raw triangle meshes. Any of the three types of visualizations presented helped participants to answer correctly, whereas once the visualization was missing, answers were almost equally distributed among all the possible options. Moreover, when participant were shown meshes without a visualization, more time elapsed by the time they arrived at the wrong answer.
