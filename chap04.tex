\chapter{Discussion}

In this chapter, we conclude the user study with a discussion of its results and setting and we suggest possible future improvements. In addition to that, we also include other observations and results of the new visualizations.

\section{Study}

We begin with an overview of the most significant results of the user study.

\subsection{Significant Results}

We have picked four questions from the study which fulfilled out expectations from section \ref{sec:analysis-color} to a certain extent or even yielded unexpected outcome.

\subsubsection{The Overall Contribution of Visualizations}

The answers to question 7 (see appendix \ref{sec:study-question7}), which requires participants to click on the face which has larger cheekbones has shown an overwhelming dominance of visualizations over raw triangle meshes. Any of the three types of visualizations presented helped participants to answer correctly, whereas once the visualization was missing, answers were almost equally distributed among all the possible options. Moreover, when participants were shown meshes without a visualization, it took them longer to arrive at a wrong answer. Similar effect could be observed in the answers to question 8 (see appendix \ref{sec:study-question8}).
